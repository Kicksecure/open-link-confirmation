Description: Asks for confirmation before opening links
 Asks before a link is (accidentally) opened in a browser.
 .
 Currently only the Tor Browser starter from the tb-starter package (by Whonix
 developers) supports using open-link-confirmation.

 Supported browsers include brave-browser, chromium, firefox, mullvad-browser,
 browser-choice, torbrowser (shell starter wrapper by Whonix developer).
 Otherwise falls back to x-www-browser.
 .
 Support for additional browser could be easily added.
 .
 On an Anonymity Gateway (when the anon-gw-base-files package is installed), it
 honors the $EDITOR environment variable (falls back to mousepad if unset), asks
 if a file should be opened in an editor before opening it and informs, that
 opening links on a Gateway is unsupported for security reasons.
 .
 Shortens excessively links to 128 characters and sanitizes potentially malicious
 unicode and HTML using `sanitize-string` (which is provided by the helper-scripts
 package).
 .
 Sets itself up as default BROWSER environment variable. Extends the
 XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variables to configure XDG scheme
 handlers.
 .
